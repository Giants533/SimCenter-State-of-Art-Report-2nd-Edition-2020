  abstract: >-
    Motivated by the observed (successful and unsuccessful) performance of
    numerous structures on top of, or immediately next to a normal fault that
    ruptured during the Kocaeli 1999 earthquake, this paper: (i) develops a
    two-step finite element methodology to study the propagation of a fault
    rupture through soil and its interplay with the foundation–structure system,
    denoted hereafter “Fault Rupture–Soil– Foundation–Structure Interaction”
    (FR–SFSI), (ii) provides validation of the developed methodology through
    successful Class “A” predictions of centrifuge model tests, and (iii)
    applies the centrifuge-validated methodology to study one-by-one the Kocaeli
    case histories of the first paper (Part I). It is shown that the presence of
    a structure on top of an outcropping fault may have a significant influence
    on the rupture path: with heavy structures founded on continuous and rigid
    foundations, the fault rupture diverts substantially and may avoid rupturing
    underneath the structure. The latter undergoes rigid body rotation, with its
    foundation sometimes loosing contact with the bearing soil, but in most
    cases retaining its structural integrity. In stark contrast, buildings on
    isolated footings and, perhaps surprisingly, piles exert a smaller diversion
    of the rupture which is thus likely to outcrop between the footings or pile
    caps; the latter may thus undergo devastating differential displacements. It
    is shown that structures in the vicinity of faults can be designed to
    survive significant dislocations. The “secret” of successful performance
    lies on the continuity, stiffness, and rigidity of the foundation.

  abstract: >-
    Field evidence from recent earthquakes has shown that structures can be
    designed to survive major surface dislocations. This paper: (i) Describes
    three different finite element (FE) methods of analysis, that were developed
    to simulate dip slip fault rupture propagation through soil and its
    interaction with foundation–structure systems; (ii) Validates the developed
    FE methodologies against centrifuge model tests that were conducted at the
    University of Dundee, Scotland; and (iii) Utilises one of these analysis
    methods to conduct a short parametric study on the interaction of idealised
    2- and 5-story residential structures lying on slab foundations subjected to
    normal fault rupture. The comparison between numerical and centrifuge model
    test results shows that reliable predictions can be achieved with reasonably
    sophisticated constitutive soil models that take account of soil softening
    after failure. A prerequisite is an adequately refined FE mesh, combined
    with interface elements with tension cut-off between the soil and the
    structure. The results of the parametric study reveal that the increase of
    the surcharge load q of the structure leads to larger fault rupture
    diversion and “smoothing” of the settlement profile, allowing reduction of
    its stressing. Soil compliance is shown to be beneficial to the stressing of
    a structure. For a given soil depth H and imposed dislocation h, the
    rotation Δθ of the structure is shown to be a function of: (a) its location
    relative to the fault rupture; (b) the surcharge load q; and (c) soil
    compliance.

  abstract: >-
    The last decade of performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) research
    has seen a rapidly increasing emphasis placed on the explicit quantiﬁcation
    of uncertainties. This paper examines uncertainty consideration in input
    ground-motion and numerical seismic response analyses as part of PBEE, with
    particular attention given to the physical consistency and completeness of
    uncertainty consideration. It is argued that the use of the commonly adopted
    incremental dynamic analysis leads to a biased representation of the seismic
    intensity and that when considering the number of ground motions to be used
    in seismic response analyses, attention should be given to both reducing
    parameter estimation uncertainty and also limiting ground-motion selection
    bias. Research into uncertainties in system-speciﬁc numerical seismic
    response analysis models to date has been largely restricted to the
    consideration of ‘low-level’ constitutive model parameter uncertainties.
    However, ‘high-level’ constitutive model and model methodology uncertainties
    are likely signiﬁcant and therefore represent a key research area in the
    coming years. It is also argued that the common omission of high-level
    seismic response analysis modelling uncertainties leads to a fallacy that
    ground-motion uncertainty is more signiﬁcant than numerical modelling
    uncertainty. The author’s opinion of the role of uncertainty analysis in
    PBEE is also presented. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

  abstract: >-
    Earthquake fault ruptures may emerge at the ground surface causing large
    differential movements. When fault ruptures emerge at or adjacent to the
    position of existing foundations, significant damage can be caused. However,
    the study of recent faulting events revealed that in some circumstances the
    fault-rupture emergence is deflected by the presence of buildings leaving
    the buildings intact. A centrifuge modelling study has been conducted to
    investigate how normal faults interact with strip foundations which run
    parallel to the strike direction. The study confirms that fault rupture may
    be deviated by the presence of the foundation so that the foundation is
    protected from the most serious differential movements. However, whilst the
    fault propagates to the soil surface the foundation has to withstand initial
    movements before the final fault rupture emergence mechanism is activated.
    The centrifuge results suggest that it is the bearing pressure of the
    foundation which causes the deviation of the fault rather than the kinematic
    restraint of the foundation. The interaction between the earthquake fault
    and the shallow foundation depends on the foundation bearing pressure,
    foundation width, soil depth and position of the fault relative to the
    foundation and these aspects should be considered in design. Results from
    the tests are used to validate a series of finite element analyses as
    reported in an accompanying paper.

  abstract: >-
    The propagation of reverse faults through soil to the ground surface has
    been observed to cause damage to surface infrastructure. However, the
    interaction between a fault propagating through a sand layer and a shallow
    foundation can be beneficial for heavily loaded foundations by causing
    deviation of the fault away from the foundation. This was studied in a
    series of centrifuge model tests in which reverse faults of dip angle 60°
    (at bedrock level) were initiated through a sand layer, close to shallow
    foundations. The tests revealed subtle interaction between the fault and the
    shallow foundation so that the foundation and soil response depend on the
    foundation loading, position, breadth and flexibility. Heavily loaded rigid
    foundations appeared best able to deviate fault rupture away from the
    foundation but this deviation could be associated with significant
    foundation rotations. However, a lightly loaded foundation was unable to
    deviate a reverse fault and the fault emerged beneath the foundation. This
    led to gapping beneath the foundation as well as significant rotations and
    may cause severe structural distress. As well as providing insight into the
    mechanisms of behaviour, the data from the tests is used to validate finite
    element analyses in a separate article.

    This paper critically reviews seismic design practices in light of the
    observed performance of landfills during recent earthquakes. Developments in
    these areas are summarized as follows: earthquake ground motions, dynamic
    waste fill properties, dynamic responses of geomembranes and their
    interfaces, nonlinear dynamic response analysis, and seismic stability
    evaluation. A newly developed simplified seismic analysis procedure that
    requires the most critical factors be addressed during a seismic performance
    evaluation is presented. The underlying seismic analysis procedure has been
    validated against observed performance of landfills shaken by the 1989 Loma
    Prieta and 1994 Northridge, California earthquakes. The procedure is
    comprehensive in that it requires: (i) characterization of the design
    bedrock motions in terms of intensity, frequency content, and duration; (ii)
    estimation of the seismic loading at the base and cover of the landfill;
    (iii) e valuation of performance in terms of seismically induced permanent
    deformations; and (iv) appropriate engineering judgment.

  abstract: >-
    Widespread liquefaction occurred in the end-dumped gravelly fills and
    hydraulically-placed dredged sandy fill at the CentrePort of Wellington as a
    result of the 14 November 2016 Mw7.8 Kaikoura earthquake. This liquefaction
    resulted in substantial global (mass) settlement and lateral movement
    (spreading) of the fills towards the sea, which adversely affected wharf
    structures and buildings constructed on shallow and deep foundations. This
    paper presents key observations from the QuakeCoRE-GEER post-earthquake
    reconnaissance efforts at the CentrePort Wellington. The different materials
    and methods used to construct the reclaimed land at CentrePort influenced
    the patterns of observed liquefaction and its effects. Areas of gravel
    liquefaction at the port are especially important due to the limited number
    of these case histories in the literature. Liquefaction-induced ground
    deformations caused the wharves to displace laterally and damage their piles
    and offloading equipment. Lateral ground extension and differential
    settlement damaged buildings, whereas buildings in areas of uniform ground
    settlement without lateral extension performed significantly better.

  abstract: >-
    Robust estimation of collapse risk should consider the uncertainty in
    modeling of structures as well as variability in earthquake ground motions.
    In this paper, we illustrate incorporation of the uncertainty in structural
    model parameters in nonlinear dynamic analyses to probabilistically assess
    story drifts and collapse risk of buildings. Monte Carlo simulations with
    Latin hypercube sampling are performed on ductile and non-ductile reinforced
    concrete building archetypes to quantify the influence of modeling
    uncertainties and how it is affected by the ductility and collapse modes of
    the structures. Inclusion of modeling uncertainty is shown to increase the
    mean annual frequency of collapse by approximately 1.8 times, as compared
    with analyses neglecting modeling uncertainty, for a high-seismic site.
    Modeling uncertainty has a smaller effect on drift demands at levels usually
    considered in building codes; for the same buildings, modeling uncertainty
    increases the mean annual frequency of exceeding story drift ratios of 0.03
    by 1.2 times. A novel method is introduced to relate drift demands at
    maximum considered earthquake intensities to collapse safety through a joint
    distribution of deformation demand and capacity. This framework enables
    linking seismic performance goals specified in building codes to drift
    limits and other acceptance criteria. The distributions of drift demand at
    maximum considered earthquake and capacity of selected archetype structures
    enable comparisons with the proposed seismic criteria for the next edition
    (2016) of ASCE 7. Subject to the scope of our study, the proposed drift
    limits are found to be unconservative, relative to the target collapse
    safety in ASCE 7. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

  abstract: >-
    Regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessments have traditionally
    been based on infinite-slope analyses, considering only a single mode of
    failure. Inventories and landslide reconnaissance work have shown a diverse
    range of coseismic landslide modes with significantly different consequences
    of failure. This paper presents a multimodal approach for regional-scale
    coseismic landslide hazard assessment. Through a two-step procedure, the
    multimodal method explicitly accounts for four general landslide types
    commonly observed during earthquakes: rock-slope failures, disrupted soil
    slides, coherent rotational slides, and lateral spreads. First, the
    susceptibility to each landslide mode is evaluated based on topography.
    Second, coseismic landslide hazards are assessed using mode-specific
    geotechnical models. A trial multimodal landslide assessment is presented
    for the seismically active country of Lebanon. Results show that the
    computed coseismic landslide hazard closely matches field-verified slope
    activity across different regions of the country exhibiting a range of
    failure modes. These results qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of the
    procedure and suggest that multimodal coseismic landslide hazard analysis is
    especially well-suited for regions with varying terrain and where landslide
    inventories are not available.

  abstract: "The growing risk of natural and artificial or manufactured hazards combined with a lack of community preparedness have revealed the necessity for comprehensive and effective metrics for evaluating and improving a community’s resilience, i.e.,\_the ability of communities to prepare for, withstand, and recover from disasters. In this paper, the authors review existing community resilience metrics and tools, classifying them into one of three main categories: community-level, sector-specific, or sociological. The paper provides short descriptions of each metric and comparisons across metrics within the three main categories and across classes. The authors assess the strengths and limitations of these metrics, discuss challenges in improving community resilience, and provide recommendations for the development of new measures of resilience. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future of community resilience, particularly the need for metrics that apply across hazards, geographic areas, and factors affecting resilience. The authors propose that effective metrics are characterized by: breadth, measures that address community resilience comprehensively; utility, measures that are able to be utilized by the relevant entities to undertake actions to improve resilience; and scientific merit, measures that are scientifically validated through statistical methods, case studies, and fieldwork."

  abstract: >-
    Engineers often use simplified seismic slope displacement procedures to
    evaluate the seismic performance of earth structures and natural slopes.
    Current state of practice procedures typically separate the estimation of
    the ground motion intensity measure (IM) from the estimate of seismic
    displacement (D), given the selected IM hazard level. Thus D is estimated
    based on a single IM value. A straightforward performance-based seismic
    slope assessment procedure is proposed, which considers the full range of
    potential IM values to estimate seismic slope displacements directly related
    to a hazard level. Seismic performance is assessed through either a
    Newmark-type seismic displacement estimate or a calibrated seismic
    coefficient that can be used in pseudostatic slope stability analyses. The
    procedures were developed for a wide range of earth systems for shallow
    crustal earthquakes and subduction zone earthquakes. Currently employed
    simplified slope displacement procedures do not provide consistent
    assessments of the actual seismic slope displacement hazard. The proposed
    procedures can be readily used in practice to perform rigorous
    performance-based seismic slope displacement hazard assessments.

  abstract: >-
    Research on the influence of tsunamis on bridges has been based almost
    exclusively on the results of field surveys and of two-dimensional analysis.
    Although these analyses can provide estimates of forces and moments on the
    structure, they do not account for three-dimensional (3D) phenomena, such as
    channelization, or geometric effects, such as bridge skew. Using a 3D
    computational fluid dynamics approach, this work analyzes the temporal and
    spatial dynamics of a bore-type tsunami loading on a model bridge and shows
    how the skew angle of the bridge relative to the incoming wave can affect
    the loading history. The analyses found that, unlike a bridge without skew,
    (1) the bore impact forces on the skewed deck do not all occur at the same
    time; (2) the skewed bridge is subjected to a force perpendicular to its
    abutments, which could lead to unseating; and (3) the skewed bridge is
    subjected to pitching and spinning moments. These effects combine to lead to
    increased horizontal reactions in the substructure components nearest the
    incoming wave. The vertical reactions were relatively insensitive to skew
    angle.

  abstract: >-
    Surface fault rupture can be damaging to structures built on or near active
    faults if the hazard is not addressed properly. Fault-induced angular
    distortion and lateral ground strain can cause beams to yield and eventually
    lead to structural collapse. When avoidance is not possible, geotechnical
    mitigation strategies can be used. These strategies include spreading fault
    displacement over a large area, causing the structure to respond with
    rigid-body movement, and diverting the fault rupture around the structure.
    The effectiveness of these strategies can vary from protecting life safety
    to preventing significant damage and can be effective for a range of
    dip-slip fault displacements. Earth fills should be sufficiently thick and
    ductile to prevent the underlying fault dislocation from developing at the
    ground surface. Thick RC mat foundations proved to be especially effective
    in shielding the superstructure from the damaging effects of the underlying
    ground movements. Although more challenging to implement because they
    require excellent fault characterization, several fault diversion strategies
    have also proved effective at protecting structures from fault movement.

    A unified model for predicting earthquake-induced sliding displacements of
    rigid and flexible slopes
  type: article-journal
  volume: '122'

- id: rathje2014probabilistic
  abstract: >-
    Sliding block displacements are used to evaluate the potential for seismic
    slope instability. Deterministic approaches are typically used to predict
    the expected level of sliding block displacement, although they do not
    rigorously account for uncertainties in the expected ground shaking, dynamic
    response, or displacement prediction. As a result, there is no concept of
    the actual hazard associated with the displacement computed by the
    deterministic approach. This paper summarizes and extends recent
    developments related to the probabilistic assessment of sliding block
    displacements. The probabilistic approach generates a hazard curve for
    displacement in which the annual rate of exceedance for a range of
    displacement levels is computed. The probabilistic approach is formulated
    both in terms of scalar hazard analysis (i.e., using one ground motion
    parameter, peak ground acceleration) and vector hazard analysis (i.e., using
    two ground motion parameters, peak ground acceleration and peak ground
    velocity), and applied both to rigid and flexible sliding block conditions.
    Generally, the vector probabilistic approach predicts displacements that are
    2–3 times smaller than the scalar probabilistic approach, revealing the
    value of characterizing frequency content via peak ground velocity.
    Comparisons between the deterministic and probabilistic approaches, in
    either a scalar or vector context, indicate that the deterministic approach
    can severely underestimate displacements relative to the probabilistic
    approach because it ignores the aleatory variabilities in the dynamic and
    sliding responses of the sliding mass. This under-prediction is most
    significant for longer period sliding masses. Modifications to the
    deterministic approach are proposed that provide displacements that are more
    consistent with the probabilistic approach.

  abstract: >-
    The factors to be considered in the earthquake-resistant design of dams are
    discussed and defensive measures which may be taken to mitigate the effects
    of these factors are summarized. Available information concerning the field
    performance of dams during earthquakes is reviewed and conclusions are drawn
    concerning the potential for earthquake-induced sliding for different types
    of construction materials and earthquake shaking intensities. Finally,
    available methods for evaluating the stability and deformations of the
    slopes of a dam due to earthquake shaking are reviewed and their
    applicability illustrated. Conclusions are drawn concerning the significance
    of the type of soil used for construction and the possibility of delayed
    failure, after the earthquake ground motions have stopped, due to pore water
    pressure re-distribution within an embankment. Suggestions are made
    concerning the appropriate role of analytical procedures in the overall
    assessment of the seismic stability of dams in relation to the uncertainties
    involved in the analysis procedures. L'article traite des facteurs à prendre
    en considération lors de la conception parasismique de barrages et résume
    les mesures de protection qui peuvent étre prises en vue d'atténuer les
    effets de ces facteurs. On y trouvera un examen des données disponibles
    relatives au comportement in situ de barrages au tours de séismes ainsi que
    les conclusions sur le glissement susceptible de se produire par suite de
    séismes dans le cas de différents types de matériaux de construction et pour
    des secousses sismiques d'intensités différentes. Enfin. l'article masse en
    revue les méthodes dont on disposepour évaiuer la stabilité et les
    déformations des talus d'un barrage suite à des secousses sismiques, et
    indique leurs applications possibles. If fait état de conclusions relatives
    à l'importance du type de sol utilisé pour la construction et à
    l'éventualité d'un retard de la rupture, une fois que les mouvements de
    terrain dus aux séismes ont cessé, en raison d'une redistribution de la
    pression de l'eau interstitielle au sein du remblai. On trouvera des
    suggestions relatives au rôle que devraient jouer les méthodes analytiques
    au niveau de l'évaluation globale de la stabilité sismique de barrages, et
    un exposé des incertitides que cornportent ces méthodes.

    This chapter describes the SYNER-G Fragility Function Manager, which has
    been developed to store, visualize and manage a large number of fragility
    function sets. The tool can store functions for a wide range of elements at
    risk, and has features that allow these functions to be harmonized (in terms
    of intensity measure type and limit state) and then compared. The tool is
    provided, together with a collection of European fragility functions, as an
    electronic supplement to this book.

  abstract: >-
    In this work, we revisit the global average pooling layer proposed in [13],
    and shed light on how it explicitly enables the convolutional neural network
    (CNN) to have remarkable localization ability despite being trained on
    imagelevel labels. While this technique was previously proposed as a means
    for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic
    localizable deep representation that exposes the implicit attention of CNNs
    on an image. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we
    are able to achieve 37.1% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014
    without training on any bounding box annotation. We demonstrate in a variety
    of experiments that our network is able to localize the discriminative image
    regions despite just being trained for solving classification task1.
