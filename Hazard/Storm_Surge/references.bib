  abstract = {Widespread liquefaction occurred in the end-dumped gravelly fills and hydraulically-placed dredged sandy fill at the CentrePort of Wellington as a result of the 14 November 2016 Mw7.8 Kaikoura earthquake. This liquefaction resulted in substantial global (mass) settlement and lateral movement (spreading) of the fills towards the sea, which adversely affected wharf structures and buildings constructed on shallow and deep foundations. This paper presents key observations from the QuakeCoRE-GEER post-earthquake reconnaissance efforts at the CentrePort Wellington. The different materials and methods used to construct the reclaimed land at CentrePort influenced the patterns of observed liquefaction and its effects. Areas of gravel liquefaction at the port are especially important due to the limited number of these case histories in the literature. Liquefaction-induced ground deformations caused the wharves to displace laterally and damage their piles and offloading equipment. Lateral ground extension and differential settlement damaged buildings, whereas buildings in areas of uniform ground settlement without lateral extension performed significantly better.},

  abstract = {Engineers often use simplified seismic slope displacement procedures to evaluate the seismic performance of earth structures and natural slopes. Current state of practice procedures typically separate the estimation of the ground motion intensity measure (IM) from the estimate of seismic displacement (D), given the selected IM hazard level. Thus D is estimated based on a single IM value. A straightforward performance-based seismic slope assessment procedure is proposed, which considers the full range of potential IM values to estimate seismic slope displacements directly related to a hazard level. Seismic performance is assessed through either a Newmark-type seismic displacement estimate or a calibrated seismic coefficient that can be used in pseudostatic slope stability analyses. The procedures were developed for a wide range of earth systems for shallow crustal earthquakes and subduction zone earthquakes. Currently employed simplified slope displacement procedures do not provide consistent assessments of the actual seismic slope displacement hazard. The proposed procedures can be readily used in practice to perform rigorous performance-based seismic slope displacement hazard assessments.},

  abstract = {Sliding block displacements are used to evaluate the potential for seismic slope instability. Deterministic approaches are typically used to predict the expected level of sliding block displacement, although they do not rigorously account for uncertainties in the expected ground shaking, dynamic response, or displacement prediction. As a result, there is no concept of the actual hazard associated with the displacement computed by the deterministic approach. This paper summarizes and extends recent developments related to the probabilistic assessment of sliding block displacements. The probabilistic approach generates a hazard curve for displacement in which the annual rate of exceedance for a range of displacement levels is computed. The probabilistic approach is formulated both in terms of scalar hazard analysis (i.e., using one ground motion parameter, peak ground acceleration) and vector hazard analysis (i.e., using two ground motion parameters, peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity), and applied both to rigid and flexible sliding block conditions. Generally, the vector probabilistic approach predicts displacements that are 2–3 times smaller than the scalar probabilistic approach, revealing the value of characterizing frequency content via peak ground velocity. Comparisons between the deterministic and probabilistic approaches, in either a scalar or vector context, indicate that the deterministic approach can severely underestimate displacements relative to the probabilistic approach because it ignores the aleatory variabilities in the dynamic and sliding responses of the sliding mass. This under-prediction is most significant for longer period sliding masses. Modifications to the deterministic approach are proposed that provide displacements that are more consistent with the probabilistic approach.},

Available information concerning the field performance of dams during earthquakes is reviewed and conclusions are drawn concerning the potential for earthquake-induced sliding for different types of construction materials and earthquake shaking intensities. Finally, available methods for evaluating the stability and deformations of the slopes of a dam due to earthquake shaking are reviewed and their applicability illustrated. Conclusions are drawn concerning the significance of the type of soil used for construction and the possibility of delayed failure, after the earthquake ground motions have stopped, due to pore water pressure re-distribution within an embankment. Suggestions are made concerning the appropriate role of analytical procedures in the overall assessment of the seismic stability of dams in relation to the uncertainties involved in the analysis procedures. L'article traite des facteurs à prendre en considération lors de la conception parasismique de barrages et résume les mesures de protection qui peuvent étre prises en vue d'atténuer les effets de ces facteurs. On y trouvera un examen des données disponibles relatives au comportement in situ de barrages au tours de séismes ainsi que les conclusions sur le glissement susceptible de se produire par suite de séismes dans le cas de différents types de matériaux de construction et pour des secousses sismiques d'intensités différentes. Enfin. l'article masse en revue les méthodes dont on disposepour évaiuer la stabilité et les déformations des talus d'un barrage suite à des secousses sismiques, et indique leurs applications possibles. If fait état de conclusions relatives à l'importance du type de sol utilisé pour la construction et à l'éventualité d'un retard de la rupture, une fois que les mouvements de terrain dus aux séismes ont cessé, en raison d'une redistribution de la pression de l'eau interstitielle au sein du remblai. On trouvera des suggestions relatives au rôle que devraient jouer les méthodes analytiques au niveau de l'évaluation globale de la stabilité sismique de barrages, et un exposé des incertitides que cornportent ces méthodes.},
