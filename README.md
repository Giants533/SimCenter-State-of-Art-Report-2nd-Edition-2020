# SimCenter 2020 SOTA 2e

## Citations

The following is an experimental workflow for working with citations.

The file `autobib-NO-EDITS.bib` is being automatically synced with a Zotero library that is hosted [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2593793/simcenter_sota/library) (Send an email to `claudio_perez` at `berkeley.edu` to be added as a contributor). This will (1) provide an intuitive interface for collaborators who are unfamiliar with BibTex, (2) enforce a consistent scheme for the generation of citation keys across the project, and (3) aid in reducing duplicate bibliography entries.
