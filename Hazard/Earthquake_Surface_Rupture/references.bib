  abstract = {Field evidence from recent earthquakes has shown that structures can be designed to survive major surface dislocations. This paper: (i) Describes three different finite element (FE) methods of analysis, that were developed to simulate dip slip fault rupture propagation through soil and its interaction with foundation--structure systems; (ii) Validates the developed FE methodologies against centrifuge model tests that were conducted at the University of Dundee, Scotland; and (iii) Utilises one of these analysis methods to conduct a short parametric study on the interaction of idealised 2- and 5-story residential structures lying on slab foundations subjected to normal fault rupture. The comparison between numerical and centrifuge model test results shows that reliable predictions can be achieved with reasonably sophisticated constitutive soil models that take account of soil softening after failure. A prerequisite is an adequately refined FE mesh, combined with interface elements with tension cut-off between the soil and the structure. The results of the parametric study reveal that the increase of the surcharge load q of the structure leads to larger fault rupture diversion and ``smoothing'' of the settlement profile, allowing reduction of its stressing. Soil compliance is shown to be beneficial to the stressing of a structure. For a given soil depth H and imposed dislocation h, the rotation $\Delta$$\theta$ of the structure is shown to be a function of: (a) its location relative to the fault rupture; (b) the surcharge load q; and (c) soil compliance.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the observed (successful and unsuccessful) performance of numerous structures on top of, or immediately next to a normal fault that ruptured during the Kocaeli 1999 earthquake, this paper: (i) develops a two-step finite element methodology to study the propagation of a fault rupture through soil and its interplay with the foundation--structure system, denoted hereafter ``Fault Rupture--Soil-- Foundation--Structure Interaction'' (FR--SFSI), (ii) provides validation of the developed methodology through successful Class ``A'' predictions of centrifuge model tests, and (iii) applies the centrifuge-validated methodology to study one-by-one the Kocaeli case histories of the first paper (Part I). It is shown that the presence of a structure on top of an outcropping fault may have a significant influence on the rupture path: with heavy structures founded on continuous and rigid foundations, the fault rupture diverts substantially and may avoid rupturing underneath the structure. The latter undergoes rigid body rotation, with its foundation sometimes loosing contact with the bearing soil, but in most cases retaining its structural integrity. In stark contrast, buildings on isolated footings and, perhaps surprisingly, piles exert a smaller diversion of the rupture which is thus likely to outcrop between the footings or pile caps; the latter may thus undergo devastating differential displacements. It is shown that structures in the vicinity of faults can be designed to survive significant dislocations. The ``secret'' of successful performance lies on the continuity, stiffness, and rigidity of the foundation.},

  abstract = {Earthquake fault ruptures may emerge at the ground surface causing large differential movements. When fault ruptures emerge at or adjacent to the position of existing foundations, significant damage can be caused. However, the study of recent faulting events revealed that in some circumstances the fault-rupture emergence is deflected by the presence of buildings leaving the buildings intact. A centrifuge modelling study has been conducted to investigate how normal faults interact with strip foundations which run parallel to the strike direction. The study confirms that fault rupture may be deviated by the presence of the foundation so that the foundation is protected from the most serious differential movements. However, whilst the fault propagates to the soil surface the foundation has to withstand initial movements before the final fault rupture emergence mechanism is activated. The centrifuge results suggest that it is the bearing pressure of the foundation which causes the deviation of the fault rather than the kinematic restraint of the foundation. The interaction between the earthquake fault and the shallow foundation depends on the foundation bearing pressure, foundation width, soil depth and position of the fault relative to the foundation and these aspects should be considered in design. Results from the tests are used to validate a series of finite element analyses as reported in an accompanying paper.},

  abstract = {The propagation of reverse faults through soil to the ground surface has been observed to cause damage to surface infrastructure. However, the interaction between a fault propagating through a sand layer and a shallow foundation can be beneficial for heavily loaded foundations by causing deviation of the fault away from the foundation. This was studied in a series of centrifuge model tests in which reverse faults of dip angle 60{\textdegree} (at bedrock level) were initiated through a sand layer, close to shallow foundations. The tests revealed subtle interaction between the fault and the shallow foundation so that the foundation and soil response depend on the foundation loading, position, breadth and flexibility. Heavily loaded rigid foundations appeared best able to deviate fault rupture away from the foundation but this deviation could be associated with significant foundation rotations. However, a lightly loaded foundation was unable to deviate a reverse fault and the fault emerged beneath the foundation. This led to gapping beneath the foundation as well as significant rotations and may cause severe structural distress. As well as providing insight into the mechanisms of behaviour, the data from the tests is used to validate finite element analyses in a separate article.},

  abstract = { Surface fault rupture can be damaging to structures built on or near active faults if the hazard is not addressed properly. Fault-induced angular distortion and lateral ground strain can cause beams to yield and eventually lead to structural collapse. When avoidance is not possible, geotechnical mitigation strategies can be used. These strategies include spreading fault displacement over a large area, causing the structure to respond with rigid-body movement, and diverting the fault rupture around the structure. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary from protecting life safety to preventing significant damage and can be effective for a range of dip-slip fault displacements. Earth fills should be sufficiently thick and ductile to prevent the underlying fault dislocation from developing at the ground surface. Thick RC mat foundations proved to be especially effective in shielding the superstructure from the damaging effects of the underlying ground movements. Although more challenging to implement because they require excellent fault characterization, several fault diversion strategies have also proved effective at protecting structures from fault movement. },
