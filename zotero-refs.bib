  abstract = {Motivated by the observed (successful and unsuccessful) performance of numerous structures on top of, or immediately next to a normal fault that ruptured during the Kocaeli 1999 earthquake, this paper: (i) develops a two-step finite element methodology to study the propagation of a fault rupture through soil and its interplay with the foundation\textendash structure system, denoted hereafter ``Fault Rupture\textendash Soil\textendash{} Foundation\textendash Structure Interaction'' (FR\textendash SFSI), (ii) provides validation of the developed methodology through successful Class ``A'' predictions of centrifuge model tests, and (iii) applies the centrifuge-validated methodology to study one-by-one the Kocaeli case histories of the first paper (Part I). It is shown that the presence of a structure on top of an outcropping fault may have a significant influence on the rupture path: with heavy structures founded on continuous and rigid foundations, the fault rupture diverts substantially and may avoid rupturing underneath the structure. The latter undergoes rigid body rotation, with its foundation sometimes loosing contact with the bearing soil, but in most cases retaining its structural integrity. In stark contrast, buildings on isolated footings and, perhaps surprisingly, piles exert a smaller diversion of the rupture which is thus likely to outcrop between the footings or pile caps; the latter may thus undergo devastating differential displacements. It is shown that structures in the vicinity of faults can be designed to survive significant dislocations. The ``secret'' of successful performance lies on the continuity, stiffness, and rigidity of the foundation.},

  abstract = {Field evidence from recent earthquakes has shown that structures can be designed to survive major surface dislocations. This paper: (i) Describes three different finite element (FE) methods of analysis, that were developed to simulate dip slip fault rupture propagation through soil and its interaction with foundation\textendash structure systems; (ii) Validates the developed FE methodologies against centrifuge model tests that were conducted at the University of Dundee, Scotland; and (iii) Utilises one of these analysis methods to conduct a short parametric study on the interaction of idealised 2- and 5-story residential structures lying on slab foundations subjected to normal fault rupture. The comparison between numerical and centrifuge model test results shows that reliable predictions can be achieved with reasonably sophisticated constitutive soil models that take account of soil softening after failure. A prerequisite is an adequately refined FE mesh, combined with interface elements with tension cut-off between the soil and the structure. The results of the parametric study reveal that the increase of the surcharge load q of the structure leads to larger fault rupture diversion and ``smoothing'' of the settlement profile, allowing reduction of its stressing. Soil compliance is shown to be beneficial to the stressing of a structure. For a given soil depth H and imposed dislocation h, the rotation {$\Delta\theta$} of the structure is shown to be a function of: (a) its location relative to the fault rupture; (b) the surcharge load q; and (c) soil compliance.},

  abstract = {The last decade of performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) research has seen a rapidly increasing emphasis placed on the explicit quantification of uncertainties. This paper examines uncertainty consideration in input ground-motion and numerical seismic response analyses as part of PBEE, with particular attention given to the physical consistency and completeness of uncertainty consideration. It is argued that the use of the commonly adopted incremental dynamic analysis leads to a biased representation of the seismic intensity and that when considering the number of ground motions to be used in seismic response analyses, attention should be given to both reducing parameter estimation uncertainty and also limiting ground-motion selection bias. Research into uncertainties in system-specific numerical seismic response analysis models to date has been largely restricted to the consideration of `low-level' constitutive model parameter uncertainties. However, `high-level' constitutive model and model methodology uncertainties are likely significant and therefore represent a key research area in the coming years. It is also argued that the common omission of high-level seismic response analysis modelling uncertainties leads to a fallacy that ground-motion uncertainty is more significant than numerical modelling uncertainty. The author's opinion of the role of uncertainty analysis in PBEE is also presented. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Earthquake fault ruptures may emerge at the ground surface causing large differential movements. When fault ruptures emerge at or adjacent to the position of existing foundations, significant damage can be caused. However, the study of recent faulting events revealed that in some circumstances the fault-rupture emergence is deflected by the presence of buildings leaving the buildings intact. A centrifuge modelling study has been conducted to investigate how normal faults interact with strip foundations which run parallel to the strike direction. The study confirms that fault rupture may be deviated by the presence of the foundation so that the foundation is protected from the most serious differential movements. However, whilst the fault propagates to the soil surface the foundation has to withstand initial movements before the final fault rupture emergence mechanism is activated. The centrifuge results suggest that it is the bearing pressure of the foundation which causes the deviation of the fault rather than the kinematic restraint of the foundation. The interaction between the earthquake fault and the shallow foundation depends on the foundation bearing pressure, foundation width, soil depth and position of the fault relative to the foundation and these aspects should be considered in design. Results from the tests are used to validate a series of finite element analyses as reported in an accompanying paper.},

  abstract = {The propagation of reverse faults through soil to the ground surface has been observed to cause damage to surface infrastructure. However, the interaction between a fault propagating through a sand layer and a shallow foundation can be beneficial for heavily loaded foundations by causing deviation of the fault away from the foundation. This was studied in a series of centrifuge model tests in which reverse faults of dip angle 60\textdegree{} (at bedrock level) were initiated through a sand layer, close to shallow foundations. The tests revealed subtle interaction between the fault and the shallow foundation so that the foundation and soil response depend on the foundation loading, position, breadth and flexibility. Heavily loaded rigid foundations appeared best able to deviate fault rupture away from the foundation but this deviation could be associated with significant foundation rotations. However, a lightly loaded foundation was unable to deviate a reverse fault and the fault emerged beneath the foundation. This led to gapping beneath the foundation as well as significant rotations and may cause severe structural distress. As well as providing insight into the mechanisms of behaviour, the data from the tests is used to validate finite element analyses in a separate article.},

Developments in these areas are summarized as follows: earthquake ground motions, dynamic waste fill properties, dynamic responses of geomembranes and their interfaces, nonlinear dynamic response analysis, and seismic stability evaluation. A newly developed simplified seismic analysis procedure that requires the most critical factors be addressed during a seismic performance evaluation is presented. The underlying seismic analysis procedure has been validated against observed performance of landfills shaken by the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge, California earthquakes. The procedure is comprehensive in that it requires: (i) characterization of the design bedrock motions in terms of intensity, frequency content, and duration; (ii) estimation of the seismic loading at the base and cover of the landfill; (iii) e valuation of performance in terms of seismically induced permanent deformations; and (iv) appropriate engineering judgment.},

  abstract = {Widespread liquefaction occurred in the end-dumped gravelly fills and hydraulically-placed dredged sandy fill at the CentrePort of Wellington as a result of the 14 November 2016 Mw7.8 Kaikoura earthquake. This liquefaction resulted in substantial global (mass) settlement and lateral movement (spreading) of the fills towards the sea, which adversely affected wharf structures and buildings constructed on shallow and deep foundations. This paper presents key observations from the QuakeCoRE-GEER post-earthquake reconnaissance efforts at the CentrePort Wellington. The different materials and methods used to construct the reclaimed land at CentrePort influenced the patterns of observed liquefaction and its effects. Areas of gravel liquefaction at the port are especially important due to the limited number of these case histories in the literature. Liquefaction-induced ground deformations caused the wharves to displace laterally and damage their piles and offloading equipment. Lateral ground extension and differential settlement damaged buildings, whereas buildings in areas of uniform ground settlement without lateral extension performed significantly better.},

  abstract = {Robust estimation of collapse risk should consider the uncertainty in modeling of structures as well as variability in earthquake ground motions. In this paper, we illustrate incorporation of the uncertainty in structural model parameters in nonlinear dynamic analyses to probabilistically assess story drifts and collapse risk of buildings. Monte Carlo simulations with Latin hypercube sampling are performed on ductile and non-ductile reinforced concrete building archetypes to quantify the influence of modeling uncertainties and how it is affected by the ductility and collapse modes of the structures. Inclusion of modeling uncertainty is shown to increase the mean annual frequency of collapse by approximately 1.8 times, as compared with analyses neglecting modeling uncertainty, for a high-seismic site. Modeling uncertainty has a smaller effect on drift demands at levels usually considered in building codes; for the same buildings, modeling uncertainty increases the mean annual frequency of exceeding story drift ratios of 0.03 by 1.2 times. A novel method is introduced to relate drift demands at maximum considered earthquake intensities to collapse safety through a joint distribution of deformation demand and capacity. This framework enables linking seismic performance goals specified in building codes to drift limits and other acceptance criteria. The distributions of drift demand at maximum considered earthquake and capacity of selected archetype structures enable comparisons with the proposed seismic criteria for the next edition (2016) of ASCE 7. Subject to the scope of our study, the proposed drift limits are found to be unconservative, relative to the target collapse safety in ASCE 7.

  abstract = {Regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessments have traditionally been based on infinite-slope analyses, considering only a single mode of failure. Inventories and landslide reconnaissance work have shown a diverse range of coseismic landslide modes with significantly different consequences of failure. This paper presents a multimodal approach for regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessment. Through a two-step procedure, the multimodal method explicitly accounts for four general landslide types commonly observed during earthquakes: rock-slope failures, disrupted soil slides, coherent rotational slides, and lateral spreads. First, the susceptibility to each landslide mode is evaluated based on topography. Second, coseismic landslide hazards are assessed using mode-specific geotechnical models. A trial multimodal landslide assessment is presented for the seismically active country of Lebanon. Results show that the computed coseismic landslide hazard closely matches field-verified slope activity across different regions of the country exhibiting a range of failure modes. These results qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of the procedure and suggest that multimodal coseismic landslide hazard analysis is especially well-suited for regions with varying terrain and where landslide inventories are not available.},

  abstract = {The growing risk of natural and artificial or manufactured hazards combined with a lack of community preparedness have revealed the necessity for comprehensive and effective metrics for evaluating and improving a community's resilience, i.e.,~the ability of communities to prepare for, withstand, and recover from disasters. In this paper, the authors review existing community resilience metrics and tools, classifying them into one of three main categories: community-level, sector-specific, or sociological. The paper provides short descriptions of each metric and comparisons across metrics within the three main categories and across classes. The authors assess the strengths and limitations of these metrics, discuss challenges in improving community resilience, and provide recommendations for the development of new measures of resilience. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future of community resilience, particularly the need for metrics that apply across hazards, geographic areas, and factors affecting resilience. The authors propose that effective metrics are characterized by: breadth, measures that address community resilience comprehensively; utility, measures that are able to be utilized by the relevant entities to undertake actions to improve resilience; and scientific merit, measures that are scientifically validated through statistical methods, case studies, and fieldwork.},

  abstract = {Engineers often use simplified seismic slope displacement procedures to evaluate the seismic performance of earth structures and natural slopes. Current state of practice procedures typically separate the estimation of the ground motion intensity measure (IM) from the estimate of seismic displacement (D), given the selected IM hazard level. Thus D is estimated based on a single IM value. A straightforward performance-based seismic slope assessment procedure is proposed, which considers the full range of potential IM values to estimate seismic slope displacements directly related to a hazard level. Seismic performance is assessed through either a Newmark-type seismic displacement estimate or a calibrated seismic coefficient that can be used in pseudostatic slope stability analyses. The procedures were developed for a wide range of earth systems for shallow crustal earthquakes and subduction zone earthquakes. Currently employed simplified slope displacement procedures do not provide consistent assessments of the actual seismic slope displacement hazard. The proposed procedures can be readily used in practice to perform rigorous performance-based seismic slope displacement hazard assessments.},

  abstract = {Surface fault rupture can be damaging to structures built on or near active faults if the hazard is not addressed properly. Fault-induced angular distortion and lateral ground strain can cause beams to yield and eventually lead to structural collapse. When avoidance is not possible, geotechnical mitigation strategies can be used. These strategies include spreading fault displacement over a large area, causing the structure to respond with rigid-body movement, and diverting the fault rupture around the structure. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary from protecting life safety to preventing significant damage and can be effective for a range of dip-slip fault displacements. Earth fills should be sufficiently thick and ductile to prevent the underlying fault dislocation from developing at the ground surface. Thick RC mat foundations proved to be especially effective in shielding the superstructure from the damaging effects of the underlying ground movements. Although more challenging to implement because they require excellent fault characterization, several fault diversion strategies have also proved effective at protecting structures from fault movement.},

  abstract = {Sliding block displacements are used to evaluate the potential for seismic slope instability. Deterministic approaches are typically used to predict the expected level of sliding block displacement, although they do not rigorously account for uncertainties in the expected ground shaking, dynamic response, or displacement prediction. As a result, there is no concept of the actual hazard associated with the displacement computed by the deterministic approach. This paper summarizes and extends recent developments related to the probabilistic assessment of sliding block displacements. The probabilistic approach generates a hazard curve for displacement in which the annual rate of exceedance for a range of displacement levels is computed. The probabilistic approach is formulated both in terms of scalar hazard analysis (i.e., using one ground motion parameter, peak ground acceleration) and vector hazard analysis (i.e., using two ground motion parameters, peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity), and applied both to rigid and flexible sliding block conditions. Generally, the vector probabilistic approach predicts displacements that are 2\textendash 3 times smaller than the scalar probabilistic approach, revealing the value of characterizing frequency content via peak ground velocity. Comparisons between the deterministic and probabilistic approaches, in either a scalar or vector context, indicate that the deterministic approach can severely underestimate displacements relative to the probabilistic approach because it ignores the aleatory variabilities in the dynamic and sliding responses of the sliding mass. This under-prediction is most significant for longer period sliding masses. Modifications to the deterministic approach are proposed that provide displacements that are more consistent with the probabilistic approach.},

  doi = {10/d99zzf},
  abstract = {The factors to be considered in the earthquake-resistant design of dams are discussed and defensive measures which may be taken to mitigate the effects of these factors are summarized. Available information concerning the field performance of dams during earthquakes is reviewed and conclusions are drawn concerning the potential for earthquake-induced sliding for different types of construction materials and earthquake shaking intensities. Finally, available methods for evaluating the stability and deformations of the slopes of a dam due to earthquake shaking are reviewed and their applicability illustrated. Conclusions are drawn concerning the significance of the type of soil used for construction and the possibility of delayed failure, after the earthquake ground motions have stopped, due to pore water pressure re-distribution within an embankment. Suggestions are made concerning the appropriate role of analytical procedures in the overall assessment of the seismic stability of dams in relation to the uncertainties involved in the analysis procedures. L'article traite des facteurs \`a prendre en consid\'eration lors de la conception parasismique de barrages et r\'esume les mesures de protection qui peuvent \'etre prises en vue d'att\'enuer les effets de ces facteurs. On y trouvera un examen des donn\'ees disponibles relatives au comportement in situ de barrages au tours de s\'eismes ainsi que les conclusions sur le glissement susceptible de se produire par suite de s\'eismes dans le cas de diff\'erents types de mat\'eriaux de construction et pour des secousses sismiques d'intensit\'es diff\'erentes. Enfin. l'article masse en revue les m\'ethodes dont on disposepour \'evaiuer la stabilit\'e et les d\'eformations des talus d'un barrage suite \`a des secousses sismiques, et indique leurs applications possibles. If fait \'etat de conclusions relatives \`a l'importance du type de sol utilis\'e pour la construction et \`a l'\'eventualit\'e d'un retard de la rupture, une fois que les mouvements de terrain dus aux s\'eismes ont cess\'e, en raison d'une redistribution de la pression de l'eau interstitielle au sein du remblai. On trouvera des suggestions relatives au r\^ole que devraient jouer les m\'ethodes analytiques au niveau de l'\'evaluation globale de la stabilit\'e sismique de barrages, et un expos\'e des incertitides que cornportent ces m\'ethodes.},

While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that exposes the implicit attention of CNNs on an image. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1\% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014 without training on any bounding box annotation. We demonstrate in a variety of experiments that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions despite just being trained for solving classification task1.}
