  abstract = {Widespread liquefaction occurred in the end-dumped gravelly fills and hydraulically-placed dredged sandy fill at the CentrePort of Wellington as a result of the 14 November 2016 Mw7.8 Kaikoura earthquake. This liquefaction resulted in substantial global (mass) settlement and lateral movement (spreading) of the fills towards the sea, which adversely affected wharf structures and buildings constructed on shallow and deep foundations. This paper presents key observations from the QuakeCoRE-GEER post-earthquake reconnaissance efforts at the CentrePort Wellington. The different materials and methods used to construct the reclaimed land at CentrePort influenced the patterns of observed liquefaction and its effects. Areas of gravel liquefaction at the port are especially important due to the limited number of these case histories in the literature. Liquefaction-induced ground deformations caused the wharves to displace laterally and damage their piles and offloading equipment. Lateral ground extension and differential settlement damaged buildings, whereas buildings in areas of uniform ground settlement without lateral extension performed significantly better.},

  abstract = {Regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessments have traditionally been based on infinite-slope analyses, considering only a single mode of failure. Inventories and landslide reconnaissance work have shown a diverse range of coseismic landslide modes with significantly different consequences of failure. This paper presents a multimodal approach for regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessment. Through a two-step procedure, the multimodal method explicitly accounts for four general landslide types commonly observed during earthquakes: rock-slope failures, disrupted soil slides, coherent rotational slides, and lateral spreads. First, the susceptibility to each landslide mode is evaluated based on topography. Second, coseismic landslide hazards are assessed using mode-specific geotechnical models. A trial multimodal landslide assessment is presented for the seismically active country of Lebanon. Results show that the computed coseismic landslide hazard closely matches field-verified slope activity across different regions of the country exhibiting a range of failure modes. These results qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of the procedure and suggest that multimodal coseismic landslide hazard analysis is especially well-suited for regions with varying terrain and where landslide inventories are not available.}
